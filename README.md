Hi! I'm Jane Downer, and I'm a graduate student in AI at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Here you'll find samples of my coursework and projects -- most recently, a dual-discriminator generative adversarial network designed to produce ambigrams.

I'm always open to opportunities for personal and professional growth. Those interested can contact me at jdowner@hawk.iit.edu.
