Hi! I'm Jane Downer, and I'm a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My degree is in AI, and I have particular interest in Computer Vision and Natural Language processing. Here you'll find samples of my coursework in addition to a modified implementation of PointNet (original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593), a neural network designed to perform a number of segmentation and classification tasks on point cloud data.

I'm always open to opportunities for personal and professional growth. Those interested can contact me at jdowner@hawk.iit.edu.
